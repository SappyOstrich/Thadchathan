<center><img src="img/card5.png"; style=height:200px; ></center><br>  Dark Magician, known as Black Magician (ブラック・マジシャン, Burakku Majishan) in the Japanese versions, is a character version of the card, "Dark Magician".Dark Magician was created when Mahad fused his ba with "Illusion Magician", his ka while fighting Thief King Bakura.

The Dark Magician fended off the ghosts and battled Diabound. He then continued to serve the Pharaoh in the form of the Dark Magician.When "Dark Magician Girl" was Summoned by the effect of "Bond Between Teacher and Student", she became worried when she saw Paradox's monsters. Dark Magician encouraged her that victory can be assured if they joined forces with their master (in the dub, he stated that as magicians, there was no trick they couldn't pull off).
